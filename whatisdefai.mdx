# What is DeFAI?

DeFAI represents the intersection of **Decentralized Finance (DeFi)** and **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, creating a powerful new approach to crypto trading and investment.

## Zereus: DeFAI in Action

Zereus implements the DeFAI vision through a dual-layer approach:

  <Card title="Intelligence Layer (zAI)" icon="brain" color="#8A2BE2" href="/defai/intelligence-layer">
    Our AI engine processes 10,000+ data points from social media and on-chain activities to predict trends and identify opportunities before they go mainstream.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Execution Layer" icon="bolt" color="#8A2BE2" href="/defai/execution-layer">
    Our trading infrastructure enables one-click execution across multiple blockchains, eliminating the complexity of cross-chain trading.

## The Zereus Advantage

By combining intelligence with execution, Zereus solves three critical market challenges:

1. **Information Asymmetry**: Access market-moving data that's typically confined to closed channels

2. **Execution Complexity**: Trade across chains without technical barriers

3. **Speed Disadvantage**: Act on opportunities the moment they emerge
